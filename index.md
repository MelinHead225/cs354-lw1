# Background
Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language released in 2014 by Apple Inc.
## History of Swift
Swift's developement originally began in 2010 by Chris Lattner. Swift was originally developed as a replacement for Apple's previous programming language Objective-C since it lacked modern features.  While developing Swift, Apple included the ability to interoperate with the previously existing Objective-C code from previous decades.  Swift uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows for C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift code to all run within one program.  Swift was developed with the intent to support the concept of 'protcol extensibility' which allows for the creation of structs and classes.  Initially released as a proprietary language is 2014 with the release of version 2.2 in 2015 Swift became open source under the Apache License 2.0.

## Pragmatics
### Package Manager
### Inheritance
### Operator Overloading
### Libraries

## Example programs
### Example 1
```swift
// Swift empty array creation
let thisArray1 = [Int]()
let thisArray2 = [Int] = []
let thisArray3 = [String]()
```
### Example 2
```swift
// Swift code with syntax highlighting.
struct Animal {
    let nickName : String?
}
```
### Example 3
```swift
// Swift code with syntax highlighting.
struct Animal {
    let nickName : String?
}
```







# EXAMPLE MARKDOWN BELOW

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```swift
// Swift code with syntax highlighting.
struct Animal {
    let nickName : String?
}
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
